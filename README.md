# FoodLog
FoodLog makes tracking food allergies and triggers easier than ever before. The app allows you to quickly log the foods you eat using a simple, intuitive interface. Whether you're eating out or at home, you can easily input each meal, ensuring that nothing gets missed.
In addition to selecting foods from the app’s built-in database, users have the option to add new foods that may not already be listed. This means even unique dishes or homemade recipes can be accurately logged.
But FoodLog doesn't stop at just tracking your meals. Once you’ve logged what you ate, you can also specify any symptoms you experience. Whether it’s an immediate reaction like itching or something that happens later, like bloating or headaches, this feature helps you track potential triggers that might not be obvious right away.
In addition to logging symptoms, FoodLog also lets you track your mood and well-being after eating. This is especially helpful for understanding how different foods affect not only your physical health but also your emotional state. For example, after logging a meal, you can note if you feel energized, fatigued, or even irritable.
By combining meal logging, symptom tracking, and mood monitoring, FoodLog provides a complete picture of how your body reacts to various foods. Over time, it helps you identify patterns and potential triggers, which can lead to healthier, more informed food choices. Ultimately, FoodLog gives users greater control over their diet and well-being!
